‚úîÔ∏è **Techniques and Technologies**

- SwiftUI: A modern framework introduced by Apple. It Allows developers to create efficient, dynamic and visually stunning apps, across all Apple platforms.
- Swift: Powerful and versatile programming language that empowers developers to build high-performance and modern applications for Apple's ecosystem.
- ZStack: A container view that stacks its child views along the z-axis, providing depth and allowing you to overlay views on top of each other.
- withAnimation: A function that allows developers to animate changes to the user interface. It is used to wrap state mutations or view modifications that you want to animate.
- GeometryReader: A container view provided that enables developers to create layout-dependent views and make responsive UIs that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.
- Timer: A mechanism for scheduling tasks to occur repeatedly or after a certain delay. Making it useful to implement animations, updates, or any other time-based functionality.
- DragGesture: It allows developers to create draggable user interfaces, such as draggable cards, sliders, or pan gestures.
